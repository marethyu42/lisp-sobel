* Welcome!
A lisp code base that imports a ppm! You can use [[https://www.online-utility.org/image/convert/to/PPM][this]] to convert a png file to ppm file. [[https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html][This website]] uses the sobel feldman operator to view the ppm file output, or an edge-detected version of itself.

The following are screenshots of what it does:


Here's my input image (some pretty fanart [[https://x.com/Kazzafraz][(credit)]] of a D&D character I like):

Which gets converted into this (grayscaled, with a border of duplicated pixels for convolution):

And eventually turns into this! (sobel feldman!!):
